# Arbitrage Bot – Project Overview

## 📘 Project Summary

The **Bot** is an intelligent, AI-enhanced arbitrage trading system designed for the Arbitrum blockchain. It monitors price discrepancies between multiple DEXes and exploits triangular arbitrage opportunities across tokens.

This system:
- Uses **real-time Web3 on-chain price data** and **off-chain pricing from Kraken**.
- Executes profitable trades through a **single on-chain smart contract call**.
- Incorporates **Monte Carlo simulations** for profit volatility forecasting.
- Leverages an **LLM-based strategy layer** for adaptive, context-aware decision-making.
- Supports automatic **contract funding and profit sweeping** to wallet.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🧠 **AI-Augmented Strategy Layer**: LLMs (e.g., GPT) advise which routes to execute.
- 📈 **Monte Carlo Simulator**: Evaluates probabilistic outcomes to filter risky paths.
- 🔁 **Live Loop Execution**: Evaluates all supported arbitrage paths every 6 seconds.
- 🧪 **Off-Chain Profit Simulation**: Fast pre-check before spending gas.
- 🔐 **Smart Contract Execution**: Secure on-chain arbitrage settlement.
- 💸 **Auto Funding & Sweeping**: Deposit tokens in and retrieve profits out.
